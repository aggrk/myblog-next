                Discussing the so-called "God" is such a sensitive topic because
                it involves almost every aspect of any Christian's life.
                Speaking negatively about him always triggers anger in most
                believers. Those who speak badly about "God" are often regarded
                as blasphemers, and it is said that sooner or later they will
                face the fury of the "God" whom they blaspheme. Some would take
                an extra step and pray for mercy for anyone who speaks badly
                about "God," believing that they do so because they are out of
                their minds and "don't know what they are doing."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                When I was a believer in the "God" of the Bible, I used to feel
                sorry for those who believed there was no "God." I would
                earnestly pray to "God" that he would forgive them and reveal
                himself to them "that they may know him, the only true God." At
                first, I did not try to think about what had brought them to
                that conclusion. I would only assume that it was the devil who
                had deceived them and that they were spiritually captive,
                needing a savior to break them free from the chains of the
                devil.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                All of these beliefs—that "those who speak negatively about God
                will face the wrath of God," that "they are blasphemers," and
                that we should pray "that God may have mercy on them"—all
                originate from the Bible as read and understood by different
                individuals. For example, the Bible talks about judgment day, on
                which all who did contrary to what "God" instructed will face
                the consequences of their actions, including those who denied
                "God." Also, the Bible calls those who say there is no "God"
                "fools." There are also different occasions in the Bible where
                those who denied or were against "God" faced some kind of
                judgment.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                My reasons for not believing in the "God" of the Bible stem from
                my diligent devotion and study of the Bible, from logic and
                reasoning, and from my personal spiritual experience. I was a
                very devoted Christian and a very spiritual one, but there came
                a time when I needed to strengthen my relationship with "God"
                and to know him better than I had known him before—to understand
                what he wanted from me, to have a strong personal connection
                with him, and to please him. It was during this time that I came
                to my senses and realized that the Bible is one big
                contradiction, and that this would only be understood if reason
                and logic were applied, and by closely analyzing our lives—the
                good and the bad moments—with a clear and unbiased mind, a mind
                that does not lean on any religious dogma or pre-established
                beliefs.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                There were some questions that I used to ignore when I was a
                believer. Questions such as: "If God knows the end from the
                beginning, why did he create Satan when he knew he would sin?"
                "If there is nothing too hard for God, why didn't he prevent the
                devil from sinning? And why didn't he prevent Adam from
                sinning?" "If God is love, why does he allow pain and
                suffering?" These questions are very crucial and shouldn't be
                ignored. I have noticed that most believers do ignore these
                questions because they don't have answers for them. Most who
                attempt to answer say that "God is not a dictator, so he gave
                his creatures free will to choose." But this response only
                raises more questions: Why did he create this will in the first
                place if he knew it would only bring problems? Why wouldn't he
                create a perfect being who wouldn't dare to sin, who knows not
                sin? Some theologians argue that free will is necessary for
                genuine love and moral growth, or that suffering builds
                character. But if "God" is all-powerful, couldn't he achieve
                these same ends without the immense suffering we see in the
                world? And if he values free will so highly, why will he
                eventually create a world where sin is impossible?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                It does not make any sense for someone for whom "nothing is too
                hard" to create a creature who will end up suffering just
                because of "sin." An "all-powerful" being could not prevent sin
                from entering the world and could not create a creature who
                would never know sin. This does not make sense. A "God" who
                "knows the end from the beginning" knew that the creature he was
                creating would sin and that sin would bring so much suffering,
                and it would cost him "His only begotten son," yet he ignored
                that fact. He knew that sin would be so bad that it would tear
                him apart, that it would destroy his connection with the
                creatures that "He loves," that it would take years to destroy
                it, and that it would cause so much pain and suffering to the
                creatures "He loves." Yet, he proceeded with creating. What kind
                of a "God" is he? Does he sound like an "all-powerful God"? Does
                he really sound like a "God who knows the end from the
                beginning"?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                It is written that "God will destroy sin," that he will make an
                utter end to sin, and then there will be no more sin, and the
                saints will live forever in a world with no sin. That means
                "God" will make it possible for sin to end, and there will be no
                possibility for it to come again. If this will be possible in
                some days to come, why was it not possible in the beginning? Why
                didn't he make it possible for people to live without sin when
                he was creating the world? If "God" is capable of destroying sin
                and making an utter end of it, why didn't he destroy it at the
                beginning? Some say that the future sinless state will be
                different because it will include beings who have chosen
                righteousness through their experience with evil—that this
                knowledge somehow makes their goodness more valuable. But this
                argument falls apart when we consider the cost: countless
                generations of suffering, pain, death, and evil, all so that the
                final generation can live in a world that "God" apparently could
                have created from the start. Is the "character development" of
                some really worth the eternal damnation of others? Or if by
                destroying sin it was meant "restoring the world to its previous
                state before sin," then wouldn't there be any possibility for
                another angel to go against "God" and bring sin again since they
                still have free will, and the circle of events repeats?
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                There are also some events in the Bible that make many doubt the
                love of "God" for the creatures he created. For example, in 2
                Samuel 12:11-14, "God" punishes David for orchestrating Uriah's
                death and taking his wife. First, the innocent child born to
                David and Bathsheba dies. Then "God" declares: "I will raise up
                adversity against you from your own house; and I will take your
                wives before your eyes and give them to your neighbor, and he
                shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun." Now, is
                this even fair? Why would a loving "God" let innocent people—the
                child, the wives—be punished for the sin of another? Why didn't
                "God" punish David directly without inflicting pain on his
                innocent wives in front of all Israel? Is that an act of love?
                There are so many other actions done by "God" that I believe are
                not the actions of love. He let the people he "loved so much"
                suffer in slavery for generations. He ordered the complete
                destruction of entire cities, including children. He killed the
                firstborn of Egypt to prove he is "God." This looks like a
                hypocritical God who in some places says he is "loving and kind"
                while in other places he commits actions that are not of love
                and kindness.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                Another reason I do not believe in this "God" is that most of
                the things that are said about him and that people claim he said
                cannot be experienced, and according to my experience, they do
                not exist at all. For example, in John 14:16, "Jesus," who is
                the son of "God" and who is often claimed as "God" (which does
                not make sense), says, "And I will pray the Father, and he shall
                give you another comforter, that he may abide with you forever."
                In this verse, it is the Holy Spirit who is the comforter. Now,
                I used to believe that every believer can receive the Holy
                Spirit when they asks earnestly, and in fact, that's what is
                written in the Bible in many places in the New Testament, and
                the early believers "received the Holy Spirit." But according to
                my own experience, this is not true. I really prayed to "God"
                honestly when I was a believer. I would fast, pray at night just
                to receive the Holy Spirit, but this promise and many others
                proved impractical. I know some might say that my lack of
                experience doesn't disprove the Holy Spirit's existence—just as
                I would say their positive experiences don't prove it. But
                here's the broader problem: believers have wildly inconsistent
                experiences. Some claim powerful spiritual encounters while
                others, equally devout, experience nothing. Some pray for
                healing and recover, while others pray just as fervently and
                die. If the Holy Spirit were real and active, we would expect
                more consistency. Instead, the pattern of religious experience
                looks exactly like what we'd expect if people were interpreting
                natural events through a religious lens rather than encountering
                an actual supernatural being.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                I came to realize that we do not need an external power of the
                "Holy Spirit" or "God" to have morals, to love, or to have
                kindness. It's all within our abilities; it's our decisions. So,
                I stopped praying to "God" for the Holy Spirit. In fact, I
                stopped praying for anything because that "God" doesn't exist.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                I know many say that there is a "God" because their lives are
                successful, that when they were at their lowest, they prayed to
                "God," and he opened the "way," and things were fine. I think
                people tend to attribute their success to "God" because their
                minds lean in that direction and they are taught to believe in
                "God." But if we closely analyze our lives without any religious
                belief, we will realize that "God" has nothing to do with our
                lives. He has nothing to do with our success, our failures, our
                highs and lows, and he does not exist.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                I think many say that "God is good" because they got their dream
                job, they overcame some challenging days, they were sick and got
                healed, and so on. Their "God is good" moments are all about
                them. But I think no one would say "God is good" if we would
                consider others and what happens in the world. The moment
                someone says "God is good" because they got their meal is the
                same moment someone else dies somewhere because of hunger. The
                moment someone says "God is good" because they were healed is
                the same moment someone else dies because of a disease that has
                made them suffer for years. How is this "God" good? Or is he
                good to some? I think selfishness is what influences the
                realization that "God is good."
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4 text-base md:text-lg leading-7.5">
                In the end, my journey from devoted believer to skeptic was not
                born of rebellion or anger, but of honest inquiry and the
                courage to follow reason where it led. The contradictions I
                found in the Bible, the unanswered questions about an
                all-powerful God who seemingly chooses suffering over
                prevention, the failed promises of spiritual comfort, and the
                selective attribution of goodness to a deity while the world
                remains filled with inexplicable pain—all of these pushed me
                toward a different understanding. I no longer see disbelief as
                foolishness or blasphemy, but as intellectual honesty. I have
                found that morality, kindness, and love do not require divine
                command or supernatural assistance; they exist within us as
                human capacities we can choose to cultivate. While this
                conclusion may trouble those who still believe, and while I may
                be labeled a fool or blasphemer according to the very texts I
                once held sacred, I have found more peace in accepting reality
                as it appears to be rather than clinging to beliefs that never
                manifested in my lived experience.
